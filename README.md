#  Introduction & Overview

Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy
([SPIM, Science, 305(5686):1007-9](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/305/5686/1007))
allows in toto imaging of large specimens by acquiring image stacks from
multiple angles. However, to realize the full potential of these acquisitions
the data needs to be reconstructed. This project implements several algorithms
for the registration and fusion of multi-angle SPIM acquisitions.

# Installation

The easiest is to get the SPIM Reconstruction as part of [Fiji](http://fiji.sc/).

See also the [SPIM Registration page on the ImageJ
wiki](http://imagej.net/Multiview-Reconstruction).

For questions, bug reports, remarks and comments just use github here or send
